Discipline-driven, capital-protecting trading system (Systematic Analytical Returns) – Excel-based MVP + 1-year performance reports on U.S. indices.
# SAR – Systematic Analytical Returns

### 📌 Overview  
SAR (Systematic Analytical Returns) is a **discipline-driven, capital-protecting trading system** that delivers **high ROI across all market directions**.  
Unlike discretionary trading, SAR follows strict rules: price action relative to SAR levels determines entry and exit — no emotions, no technical guesswork.

We have already built and validated SAR through an **Excel-based MVP** with live trade logs and performance tracking.  
The system has demonstrated **strong profitability** across U.S. stocks and futures, proving its reliability and scalability.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Rule-Based Logic** – Trades triggered only when price sustains above/below SAR levels.  
- **Capital Protection** – 2-lot strategy: 1 booked at target, 1 trailed until reversal.  
- **Market Agnostic** – Works in U.S. equities, futures, and global instruments.  
- **Emotionless Execution** – Removes human bias, purely systematic.  
- **Proven Results** – Backtested + live market performance shows consistent ROI.
